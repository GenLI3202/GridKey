  abstract = {Energy Storage Technology is one of the major components of renewable energy integration and decarbonization of world energy systems. It significantly benefits addressing ancillary power services, power quality stability, and power supply reliability. However, the recent years of the COVID-19 pandemic have given rise to the energy crisis in various industrial and technology sectors. An integrated survey of energy storage technology development, its classification, performance, and safe management is made to resolve these challenges. The development of energy storage technology has been classified into electromechanical, mechanical, electromagnetic, thermodynamics, chemical, and hybrid methods. The current study identifies potential technologies, operational framework, comparison analysis, and practical characteristics. This proposed study also provides useful and practical information to readers, engineers, and practitioners on the global economic effects, global environmental effects, organization resilience, key challenges, and projections of energy storage technologies. An optimal scheduling model is also proposed. Policies for sustainable adaptation are then described. An extensive list of publications to date in the open literature is canvassed to portray various developments in this area.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion cells are subject to degradation due to a multitude of cell-internal aging effects, which can significantly influence the economics of battery energy storage systems (BESS). Since the rate of degradation depends on external stress factors such as the state-of-charge, charge/discharge-rate, and depth of cycle, it can be directly influenced through the operation strategy. In this contribution, we propose a model predictive control (MPC) framework for designing aging aware operation strategies. By simulating the entire BESS lifetime on a digital twin, different aging aware optimization models can be benchmarked and the optimal value for aging cost can be determined. In a case study, the application of generating profit through arbitrage trading on the EPEX SPOT intraday electricity market is investigated. For that, a linearized model for the calendar and cyclic capacity loss of a lithium iron phosphate cell is presented. The results show that using the MPC framework to determine the optimal aging cost can significantly increase the lifetime profitability of a BESS, compared to the prevalent approach of selecting aging cost based on the cost of the battery system. Furthermore, the lifetime profit from energy arbitrage can be increased by an additional 24.9\% when using the linearized calendar degradation model and by 29.3\% when using both the linearized calendar and cyclic degradation model, compared to an energy throughput based aging cost model. By examining price data from 2019 to 2022, the case study demonstrates that the recent increases in prices and price fluctuations on wholesale electricity markets have led to a substantial increase of the achievable lifetime profit.},

  abstract = {Energy storage is one of the hot points of research in electrical power engineering as it is essential in power systems. It can improve power system stability, shorten energy generation environmental influence, enhance system efficiency, and also raise renewable energy source penetrations. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the most popular energy storage systems including electrical energy storage systems, electrochemical energy storage systems, mechanical energy storage systems, thermal energy storage systems, and chemical energy storage systems. More than 350 recognized published papers are handled to achieve this goal, and only 272 selected papers are introduced in this work. A comparison between each form of energy storage systems based on capacity, lifetime, capital cost, strength, weakness, and use in renewable energy systems is presented in a tabular form. Selected studies concerned with each type of energy storage system have been discussed considering challenges, energy storage devices, limitations, contribution, and the objective of each study. The integration between hybrid energy storage systems is also presented taking into account the most popular types. Hybrid energy storage system challenges and solutions introduced by published research are summarized and analyzed. A selection criteria for energy storage systems is presented to support the decision-makers in selecting the most appropriate energy storage device for their application. For enormous scale power and highly energetic storage applications, such as bulk energy, auxiliary, and transmission infrastructure services, pumped hydro storage and compressed air energy storage are currently suitable. Battery, flywheel energy storage, super capacitor, and superconducting magnetic energy storage are technically feasible for use in distribution networks. With an energy density of 620 kWh/m3, Li-ion batteries appear to be highly capable technologies for enhanced energy storage implementation in the built environment. Nonetheless, lead-acid batteries continue to offer the finest balance between price and performance because Li-ion batteries are still somewhat costly. The applications of energy storage systems have been reviewed in the last section of this paper including general applications, energy utility applications, renewable energy utilization, buildings and communities, and transportation. Finally, recent developments in energy storage systems and some associated research avenues have been discussed. Academics and engineers interested in energy storage strategies might refer to this review.},

One of the promising solutions to sustain the quality and reliability of the power system is the integration of energy storage systems (ESSs). This article investigates the current and emerging trends and technologies for grid-connected ESSs. Different technologies of ESSs categorized as mechanical, electrical, electrochemical, chemical, and thermal are briefly explained. Especially, a detailed review of battery ESSs (BESSs) is provided as they are attracting much attention owing, in part, to the ongoing electrification of transportation. Then, the services that grid-connected ESSs provide to the grid are discussed. Grid connection of the BESSs requires power electronic converters. Therefore, a survey of popular power converter topologies, including transformer-based, transformerless with distributed or common dc-link, and hybrid systems, along with some discussions for implementing advanced grid support functionalities in the BESS control, is presented. Furthermore, the requirements of new standards and grid codes for grid-connected BESSs are reviewed for several countries around the globe. Finally, emerging technologies, including flexible power control of photovoltaic systems, hydrogen, and second-life batteries from electric vehicles, are discussed in this article.},

A new nonprobabilistic model is introduced in this paper to handle the uncertain nature of spinning reserve and regulation markets. Robust optimization is implemented to model these uncertain parameters and manage their related risk. The proposed risk-based model is a max-min problem, which is converted to its equivalent ordinary maximization problem using duality theory. The presented model is linearized by implementing strong duality theory. Finally, the proposed method is tested and verified using an illustrative case study.},

The EMS controls, monitors, and manages the power dispatch of different integrated sources based on the strategy that balances the demand with the supply, with the available energy sources related to solar and BESS. The EMS application strategy directly affects the BESS SOH and, thus, increases its operational remaining useful lifetime (RUL). Therefore, this study develops an intelligent EMS (iEMS) implemented within the MG based on predictive artificial neural network (ANN) control power dispatch strategy. The proposed iEMS has proved to be effective and accurate (MAE = 6.43\%) which improved and optimized the BESS SOH through the prosecution of a 6-h prediction on blackout occurrence and noncritical load shedding. Consequently the iEMS preserved the SOH to 33\% (an increase of 45\% compared to classical EMS) and decreased the blackout occurrence by 56\% (-5203 h) in contrast with the classical EMS where the SOH reached 20\% and blackout occurrences totaled 11,899 h. This proves that the model is effective, and the control logic avoids high loads being dispatched from the BESS at critical time intervals where the AI model predicts a blackout occurrence.},

The growing energy crisis has increased the emphasis on energy storage research in various sectors. The performance and efficiency of Electric vehicles (EVs) have made them popular in recent decades. The EVs are the most promising answers to global environmental issues and CO2 emissions. Battery management systems (BMS) are crucial to the functioning of EVs. An efficient BMS is crucial for enhancing battery performance, encompassing control of charging and discharging, meticulous monitoring, heat regulation, battery safety, and protection, as well as precise estimation of the State of charge (SoC). The current understanding of EV technology, its advancements, limitations, and effects on achieving BMS (Sustainable Development Goals) SDGs remains unexplored, despite the existence of several studies on the topic. This article reviews various aspects of battery storage technologies, materials, properties, and performance. This review highlights the significance of battery management systems (BMSs) in EVs and renewable energy storage systems, with detailed insights into voltage and current monitoring, charge-discharge estimation, protection and cell balancing, thermal regulation, and battery data handling. The study extensively investigates traditional and sophisticated SoC estimation methods, highlighting their pros and cons. The review underscores the critical role of advanced BMSs for successful EV adoption and addresses the challenges that must be overcome.

  abstract = {Recently, the number of Battery Energy Systems (BESs) connected to the grid has grown significantly. These assets can alleviate some operational issues such as demand surges and occasional power fluctuations associated with the Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) connected to the grid. Nonetheless, both overcharging and frequent usage severely affect their health status and shorten their life expectancy. In this paper, an Energy Management System (EMS) framework with a linearised algorithm and in-depth analysis on BES life extension is presented, which optimises the techno-economic aspects of an Active Distribution Network (ADN) connected to RESs. By applying a mathematical linearisation formulation, a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is proposed for linearising the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem. This technique, which has the merit of fair accuracy while having high speed, is used for scheduling BESs to increase their durability and decrease grid costs. To consider the inherent uncertainty associated with demand and RES generation, a two-stage Stochastic Programming (SP) method is implemented in the proposed model. In terms of battery Loss of Health (LoH) assessment, a linearised battery lifetime method is introduced. Ultimately, a modified 33-bus radial distribution test system with a day-ahead Real-Time Pricing (RTP) program was chosen to apply the proposed algorithm and assess its efficiency.},

We implement two different representations of battery degradation within an energy arbitrage model, and show that degradation has a strong impact on battery energy storage system (BESS) profitability. In a case study using historical electricity market prices from the MISO electricity market in the United States, we find that the achievable net present value (at an interest rate of 10\%) for a battery system with a C-rate of 1C dropped from 358 \$/kWh in the case considering no degradation to 194--314 \$/kWh depending on the battery degradation model and assumptions for end of life (EOL) criteria. This corresponds to a reduction in revenue due to degradation in the 12--46\% range. Moreover, we find that reducing the cycling of the battery via introducing a penalty cost in the objective function of the energy arbitrage optimization model can improve the profitability over the life of the BESS.},

In this paper we model battery cycle aging using a piecewise linear cost function, an approach that provides a close approximation of the cycle aging mechanism of electrochemical batteries and can be incorporated easily into existing market dispatch programs. By defining the marginal aging cost of each battery cycle, we can assess the actual operating profitability of batteries.

A vital aspect in energy storage planning and operations is to accurately model the aging cost of battery cells, especially in irregular cycling operations. This paper proposes a semi-empirical lithium-ion battery degradation model that assesses battery cell life loss from operating profiles. We formulate the model by combining fundamental theories of battery degradation and our observations in battery aging test results. The model is adaptable to different types of lithium-ion batteries, and methods for tuning the model coefficients based on manufacturer's data are presented. A cycle-counting method is incorporated to identify stress cycles from irregular operations, allowing the degradation model to be applied to any battery energy storage (BES) applications. The usefulness of this model is demonstrated through an assessment of the degradation that a BES would incur by providing frequency control in the PJM regulation market.},

The grid frequency regulation service and two customer-side services, i.e., energy arbitrage and peak shaving, are selected as stackable services of BTM BESS. A two-stage stochastic programming model is proposed to handle uncertainty and achieve the most cost-effective BTM BESS size. The first stage obtains the optimal BTM BESS size with the maximum annual net income. The operating strategy of the BTM BESS is optimized in the second stage to maximize revenue while considering the BTM BESS degradation cost and the uncertainty of operating scenarios. A hybrid solution algorithm combining genetic algorithm and mixed-integer linear programming is employed to solve the two-stage stochastic programming model. A strategy based on a recorder and a filter is proposed to speed up the solution. In addition, a novel method for converting the second-level regulation signal into the equivalent minute-level signal is offered to reduce computational burden while maintaining high accuracy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated based on an industrial load and regulation information from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market.},
